# Exercise 4: The travelling salesman

### About
For this last exercise you need to come up with a solution to the travelling salesman problem given the following conditions:
* There are 7 cities in total that you need to visit
* You start at city A
* The cost to visit each city from a given city is determined by the distance matrix below (see `Distance_Matrix` file for the actual distance matrix)

What is the most efficient route for the salesman to take? 
Ensuring that he visits each city exactly once and then returns to the starting city (A), while keeping his cost at a minimum. And what was the total cost for this route?

### Constraints:
* Your cost or distance of your final solution needs to be less than or equal to 10. Anything more than 10 should be considered suboptimal
